In your first request you just ask for a blog, without providing any details.
In follow-up requests, you ask for one new feature at a time.
You want the following features in your blog:
- Dark mode / Light mode switch
- Create new posts
- Delete posts
- Comments
After adding each feature, verify that it's working. If it isn't working, ask the system to fix it.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
